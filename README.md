# Task-2-Excel-Analysis---Pivot-Tables-Summary-Insights

I cleaned and standardized the dataset to remove blanks, and ensure consistent categories before analysis. The data was converted into an Excel Table to enable dynamic updates, and multiple Pivot Tables were created to analyze total sales by category, region, and segment. Interactive slicers and calculated metrics such as profit margin were added to enhance insights, supported by pivot charts for visual comparison. Finally, key business insights were documented and the report was exported as a PDF for easy sharing and decision-making.
